# Microsoft Teams Meeting API Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up Microsoft Teams meeting creation via API where you can specify any user in your tenant as the meeting organizer, enabling them to create breakout rooms.

## üéØ What This Solves

**The Problem:** When creating Teams meetings via Microsoft Graph API using delegated permissions, the authenticated user always becomes the meeting organizer. This prevents others from creating breakout rooms since only the organizer can do so.

**The Solution:** By using application permissions with an Application Access Policy, your application can create meetings where any specified user becomes the organizer and can create breakout rooms manually through the Teams UI.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Microsoft 365 Tenant** with Teams enabled
- **Global Administrator** or **Teams Administrator** role
- **Application development** permissions in Azure AD
- **PowerShell execution** permissions
- **HTTP testing tool** (Bruno, Postman, etc.)

## üöÄ Setup Overview

This setup involves **3 critical steps** that must be completed in order:

    A[Step 1: App Registration] --> B[Step 2: Teams Policy] 
    B --> C[Step 3: Testing & Verification]
    C --> D[Production Integration]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **All steps are mandatory** - skipping any step will result in API failures
- **Order matters** - complete steps sequentially 
- **Wait times required** - policy propagation takes 30-60 minutes
- **Admin permissions needed** - some steps require administrative access

## üë• Multiple Breakout Room Managers

### The Challenge
By default, only the meeting organizer can create breakout rooms. However, in many business scenarios (incident response, training sessions, large meetings), you may need **multiple people** to be able to create and manage breakout rooms.

### Available Solutions
Microsoft Teams provides several mechanisms to delegate breakout room management to others:

#### ‚úÖ **Co-Organizers (Recommended)**
- Add up to 10 co-organizers who can manage breakout rooms during live meetings
- Must be from the same organization/tenant
- Can be assigned via API at meeting creation
- Have near-organizer permissions

#### ‚úÖ **Breakout Room Managers**  
- Appoint presenters as dedicated breakout room managers
- Must be configured during the meeting or in meeting options
- Only one manager can control rooms at a time

#### ‚úÖ **Multiple Primary Organizers**
- Create different meetings with different organizers via API
- Each organizer has full breakout room control
- Requires Application Access Policy for each potential organizer

### API Implementation Example
```json
{
  "subject": "Meeting with Multiple Breakout Room Managers",
  "participants": {
    "organizer": {
      "upn": "primary.organizer@contoso.com"
    },
    "attendees": [
      {
        "upn": "co.organizer1@contoso.com",
        "role": "coOrganizer"  // ‚Üê Can create breakout rooms
      },
      {
        "upn": "co.organizer2@contoso.com", 
        "role": "coOrganizer"  // ‚Üê Can create breakout rooms
      },
      {
        "upn": "presenter@contoso.com",
        "role": "presenter"    // ‚Üê Can be breakout room manager
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Benefits
- **Redundancy**: Multiple people can manage breakout rooms if primary organizer is unavailable
- **Scalability**: Distribute breakout room management across team members
- **Flexibility**: Choose different organizers based on incident type, expertise, or availability
- **Coverage**: 24/7 incident response with different shift managers as organizers

## üîß Step 1: Create Azure App Registration

**What:** Set up an Azure AD application registration with the correct permissions and authentication credentials.

**Why:** This provides your application with the identity and permissions needed to call Microsoft Graph API on behalf of users.

### Key Components Created:
- ‚úÖ Azure AD App Registration
- ‚úÖ Application Permissions (`OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All`)  
- ‚úÖ Client Secret for authentication
- ‚úÖ Admin consent granted

### Time Required: 15 minutes

**üìñ For detailed step-by-step instructions, see: [Portal-Instructions.md](./Portal-Instructions.md)**

**Output:** You'll have a Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID needed for the next steps.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Step 2: Create Teams Application Access Policy

**What:** Configure a PowerShell-based policy that authorizes your application to create meetings on behalf of specific users.

**Why:** Even with correct app permissions, Microsoft requires an additional layer of security through Application Access Policies. Without this policy, you'll get "Access Denied" errors when trying to create meetings.

### Key Components Created:
- ‚úÖ Application Access Policy in Teams
- ‚úÖ Policy assignment to specific users or globally
- ‚úÖ Verification of policy propagation

### Critical Requirements:
- **Teams Administrator** or **Global Administrator** role required
- **PowerShell module** installation and configuration  
- **30-60 minute wait time** for policy propagation

### Time Required: 20 minutes + 30-60 minute wait time

**üìñ For detailed step-by-step instructions, see: [Teams-Policy.md](./Teams-Policy.md)**

**Output:** Users specified in the policy can have meetings created on their behalf via API.

---

## üß™ Step 3: Test with Bruno (or HTTP Client)

**What:** Verify your setup works by testing the authentication and meeting creation endpoints using an HTTP client.

**Why:** Before integrating into your production application, you need to confirm that both authentication and meeting creation work correctly with the specified organizers.

### Testing Components:
- ‚úÖ Client Credentials authentication flow
- ‚úÖ Access token generation and management
- ‚úÖ Meeting creation with specific organizers
- ‚úÖ Verification that correct user becomes organizer
- ‚úÖ Confirmation that organizer can create breakout rooms

### Recommended Tool: Bruno
We recommend **Bruno** as it's free, modern, and handles environment variables well. However, you can use any HTTP client (Postman, Insomnia, cURL, etc.).

### Time Required: 30 minutes

**üìñ For detailed Bruno setup and testing instructions, see: [Test.Bruno.md](./Test.Bruno.md)**

**Output:** Confirmed working API calls that can be integrated into your application.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Expectations

| Step | Duration | Wait Time | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Step 1: App Registration** | 15 minutes | None | 15 minutes |
| **Step 2: Teams Policy** | 20 minutes | 30-60 minutes | 50-80 minutes |  
| **Step 3: Testing** | 30 minutes | None | 30 minutes |
| **Total Setup Time** | 65 minutes | 30-60 minutes | **95-125 minutes** |

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Skipping Admin Consent
**Problem:** App permissions granted but admin consent not provided  
**Result:** Authentication fails with "consent required" errors  
**Solution:** Follow Step 1 completely, including admin consent

### ‚ùå Using Delegated Instead of Application Permissions  
**Problem:** Using `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite` (delegated) instead of `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All` (application)  
**Result:** Cannot specify different organizers, token owner becomes organizer  
**Solution:** Use application permissions as detailed in Portal-Instructions.md

### ‚ùå Testing Before Policy Propagation
**Problem:** Testing API calls immediately after creating policy  
**Result:** "Access Denied" or "Forbidden" errors  
**Solution:** Wait the full 30-60 minutes as specified in Teams-Policy.md

### ‚ùå Incorrect PowerShell Execution
**Problem:** Running policy commands without proper admin rights or module installation  
**Result:** Policy creation fails or assignments don't work  
**Solution:** Follow Teams-Policy.md exactly, ensure proper admin role

### ‚ùå Wrong Authentication Flow
**Problem:** Using user authentication instead of client credentials flow  
**Result:** Cannot create meetings for other users  
**Solution:** Use client credentials as shown in Test.Bruno.md

## üîí Security Considerations

### Principle of Least Privilege
- **Recommended:** Assign policy to specific users only
- **Avoid:** Global policy assignments unless absolutely necessary
- **Monitor:** Regular audits of who has meeting creation privileges

### Credential Security
- **Client Secret:** Store securely, rotate periodically
- **Access Tokens:** Implement proper refresh mechanisms
- **Logging:** Monitor API usage and unauthorized access attempts

### Policy Scope
```powershell
# Preferred: Specific users
Grant-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -PolicyName "YourPolicy" -Identity "user@company.com"

# Use with caution: Global assignment  
Grant-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -PolicyName "YourPolicy" -Global
```

- **Impact:** Organizers need to create breakout rooms after joining the meeting
- **Workaround:** None - this is a Microsoft Graph API limitation

### ‚ùå Policy Propagation Delays
- **Reality:** Policies can take up to 60 minutes to propagate
- **Impact:** Cannot test immediately after policy creation
- **Workaround:** Plan for wait times in your implementation timeline

### ‚ùå PowerShell Requirement
- **Reality:** Application Access Policies can only be created via PowerShell
- **Impact:** No Azure Portal UI alternative available
- **Workaround:** None - PowerShell is the only option
